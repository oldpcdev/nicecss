# NiceCSS
NiceCSS - The mix of Nice Web Design and Nice Freedom

## Why the design of the templates are old?
Not old, but better. I miss the design of 2005-2013 and want to bring back good web design again

## What happened to website-templates (repo)?
I decided to archive that repository because it was so ugly, disorganized and had a generic name... anyway, I decided to create another repository more organized

## About
NiceCSS is a project and an improved fork of website-templates where I increasingly evolve my experience with design and CSS. This repository and (almost) all files are licensed under GPL V3, which means you can modify and share but must maintain the freedom of the files.
