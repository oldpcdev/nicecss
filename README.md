NiceCSS - The mix of Web Design and Nice Freedom

## Why the design of the templates are old?
Not old, but better. I miss the design of 2005-2013 and want to bring back good web design again

## What happened to website-templates (repo)?
I decided to archive that repository because it was so ugly, disorganized and had a generic name... anyway, I decided to create another repository more organized
