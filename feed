				<h1>Why i use some “outdated” methods?</h1>
							
				<p>I know the base of the site looks like sites from 10-15 years ago, and that's <em>on purpose</em>.</p>

				<p>The reason I use these methods is the ease and control I have over the elements.</p>
				
				<p>The secret is that when you design in a professional image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc...) you can increase the detail capacity of your website to make it unique.</p>
				
				<p>These details can be applied using images; Backgrounds, borders, icons and gradients.</p>
				
				<p><em>Yes</em>. I know some of these details can be added via pure CSS, but pure CSS has no soul as it's all generated by just a few lines of code. The method of images, however, does not, because it is composed of several pixels and different colors.</p>
				
				<p>Of course I use some CSS3, like @font-face and box-sizing. The fonts are not that important but the box-sizing is crucial for the structure of the elements.</p>

				<h1>First Post</h1>

				<p>This post serves as a “changelog” and to show you step-by-step how I built NiceCSS.</p>

				<p>It took a lot of work to do it all.</p>

				<h2>Version 0.0.1.xy: Getting Started</h2>

				<p>I am ashamed of this version. In my head it seemed innovative, but in practice it was horrible and I had to rebuild it again, changing everything until I reached the BrownLooks theme.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, I didn't take screenshots. and I shall have to say right here what it looked like. The header was 30px high and 100px wide, was at the top of the screen, and had a light red to dark red gradient background. It had a banner with a bokeh background and the content was underneath it. It was terrible, you could barely see the sidebar.</p>

				<h2>Version 0.0.2.xy - 0.0.6.xy: Towards perfection</h2>

				<p>These versions were built at the last minute and I didn't sleep for a LONG time. But in the end, they were almost perfect.</p>

				<p>The 0.0.2.xy and 0.0.3.xy were the ones that defined the design of the site. I drew everything in GIMP.</p>

				<p>0.0.4 .xy- 0.0.6.xy Focused on details like the logo, icons and home page. Fixed several mini bugs. 0.0.5 was the version with the most sub-versions.</p>

				<p>No screenshots too.</p>

				<h2>Version 0.0.7.xy - 0.0.8.xy: No new ideas</h2>

				<p>These versions aren't special and didn't bring almost anything new, just a redesign of the logo, the stylization of the posts. and fixed (many) bugs in CSS.</p>
				
				<div class="img_box">
					<img src="../../../img/v0.0.8.8.jpg" alt="v0.0.8 screenshot">
					<p>Screenshot of the 0.0.8 version</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Version 0.0.9.xy - 0.1.0: Calm is the key to perfection</h2>

				<p>An (almost) happy ending for NiceCSS. What's new are bug fixes and the NiceCSS upload on GitHub Pages.</p>

				<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/instructure-ui-filled-interface-icons/" target="_blank">instructure-ui</a> for the icons and to <a href="https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/500728 /umbrella" target="_blank">element-plus</a> by the umbrella of the logo. All fonts came from Google Fonts.</p>
